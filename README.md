* Computer keys correspond with keys and pedals in a layout optimised for Valorant.
* Computer keys (X, TAB, G, C, M) were binded to the additional side buttons on the Logitech G503 Hero mouse.

# Run the program
**Ensure that the latest version of `Python 3` is installed and a MIDI piano is connected via a MIDI to USB adapter.**
